Gateways check duplicates on the gateway order ID to ensure that the merchant do not accidentally enter the same transaction twice. This ID can also be used to do reconciliation and tie the payment to a natural key in external systems. The source of this ID varies by merchant. Some merchants use their shopping cart order IDs, and others use something different. Merchants use this ID to track transactions in their eCommerce systems.
